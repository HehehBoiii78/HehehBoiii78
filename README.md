# <p align="center">Hi there! ðŸ‘‹</p>

* I love software development and I'm learning a lot of different programming languages.
* I'm learning to develop apps for Android and Windows as well as web development.
* I'm actively working on a lot of projects to publish on my profile as a repository, though I have no idea when those projects will be published. Probably in the next few years.
* To contact me, you can send a chat message to my Reddit profile, linked above.
